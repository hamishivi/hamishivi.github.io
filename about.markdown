I'm an recent graduate of the University of Sydney, and studied **computer science**, **Ancient Greek** and **linguistics**.

## Projects

I've worked on a few projects over the years, including web dev work (both as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and professionally), a Pokemon GAN, and one or two tiny games. You can find most of my personal coding projects on my [github](http://github.com/hamishivi). I've done plenty of development work at [block8](https://block8.io), and I've worked at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia multiple times. Currently, I'm just a recent graduate.
