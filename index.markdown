Hi, I'm <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ˈheɪmɪʃ]">Hamish</a>! I'm (currently) a predoctoral researcher at [AI2](https://allenai.org/) on the [AllenNLP team](https://allenai.org/allennlp), and I will be starting a PhD at the University of Washington at [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) in the fall. I'm generally interested in NLP research, with interests in making language models more easy to use and open, and trying to understand the source of their multi-task abilities.

I graduated at the end of 2020 from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts and IT, triple majoring in Linguistics, Classical Greek, and Computer Science. I was lucky enough to get the university medal and first-class honours for my undergraduate honours year thesis, for which I examined multi-hop question answering with the [UsydNLP group](https://usydnlp.info/). During (and just after) my degree, I've spent some time at the [Commonwealth Bank of Australia](https://www.commbank.com.au/), start-up-y stuff, and [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/).

If you have questions about my work, general academia/software/research-related stuff, or want to chat, feel free to reach out at hamishi [at] allenai [dot] org. I'm generally down to chat about whatever!
