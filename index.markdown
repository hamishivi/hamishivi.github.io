Hi, I'm <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ˈheɪmɪʃ]">Hamish</a>! I'm (currently) a PhD student at the University of Washington at [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/), advised by Hannaneh Hajishirzi. I'm generally interested in NLP research, with interests in making language models more easy to use and open, exploring alternative architectures, and linking model abilities and data.

I'm originally from Sydney, and did my undergraduate at the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts and IT, triple majoring in Linguistics, Classical Greek, and Computer Science. I also did some NLP with the [UsydNLP group](https://usydnlp.info/), examining multi-hop question answering. Throughout my undergrad (and just after), I spent some time at the [Commonwealth Bank of Australia](https://www.commbank.com.au/), start-up-y stuff, and [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/). Before my PhD, I was a predoctoral researcher at [AI2](https://allenai.org/) on the [AllenNLP team](https://allenai.org/allennlp).

If you have questions about my work, general academia/software/research-related stuff, or want to chat, feel free to reach out at hamishiv [at] cs [dot] washington [dot] edu. I'm generally down to chat about whatever!
