Hi, I'm Hamish! I'm (currently) a predoctoral researcher at [AI2](https://allenai.org/) on the [AllenNLP team](https://allenai.org/allennlp). I'm generally interested in NLP research, currently focusing on examining how to adapt and compose existing language systems in efficient and useful ways.

I graduated at the end of 2020 from the University of Sydney with triple majors in Linguistics, Classical Greek, and Computer Science. I received first class honours for a thesis examining applying MAC networks to question answering, working with Caren Han and [UsydNLP](https://usydnlp.info/). During (and just after) my degree, I've spent some time at the [Commonwealth Bank of Australia](https://www.commbank.com.au/), start-up-y stuff, and [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/).

If you have questions about my work, general academia/software/research-related stuff, or want to chat, feel free to reach out at hamishi [at] allenai [dot] org. I'm generally down to chat about whatever!
