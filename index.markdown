Hi, I'm <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ˈheɪmɪʃ]">Hamish</a>! I'm (currently) a PhD student at the University of Washington at [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/). I'm generally interested in NLP research, with a focus on post-training for language models. I'm interested in making language models more usable for more people, and exploring ways to improve them that go beyond next-token training. Additionally, I'm also interested in improving and exploring language model data mixtures, and have dabbled in exploring alternatives approaches to language modelling.

I'm from Sydney and did my undergraduate at the University of Sydney, doing a Bachelor of Arts and IT and triple majoring in Linguistics, Classical Greek, and Computer Science. I also did some NLP with the [UsydNLP group](https://usydnlp.info/), examining multi-hop question answering. Throughout my undergrad (and just after), I spent some time at the [Commonwealth Bank of Australia](https://www.commbank.com.au/), start-up-y stuff, and [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/). Before my PhD, I was a predoctoral researcher at [AI2](https://allenai.org/) on the [AllenNLP team](https://allenai.org/allennlp).

If you have questions about my work, general academia/software/research-related stuff, or want to chat, feel free to reach out at hamishiv [at] cs [dot] washington [dot] edu. I am generally happy to answer most questions! You can also find me on various social media at @hamishivi.

See below for papers I've worked on. You can also check out my [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Hamish-Ivison/2056776606) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JxCXMlkAAAAJ) profiles.

In addition to these, I also help maintain [Open-Instruct](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct), a codebase for general LM post-training. Send me a note if you need some help with it!
