Hi, welcome to my site! This is mainly a home for my random thoughts and little projects, technical and non-technical alike.

## Who am I?

I'm a recent university graduate and a software developer generalist, although my main interests lie in natural language processing and the classics. I graduated at the end of 2020 with triple majors in Linguistics, Classical Greek, and Computer Science. Professionally, I've done web dev and general backend work for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, full-stack blockchain developer work at [Block8](https://block8.com), and most recently done a mixture fof general developer and ops work at [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/). Check out my social media links below for more details.
