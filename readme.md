# Hamish's Blog

Just a place for my random thoughts and musings :)

To run locally (since I always forget): `bundler exec jekyll serve`
Look at [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47026174/find-spec-for-exe-cant-find-gem-bundler-0-a-gemgemnotfoundexception) for install issues.

## Quick notes to self

- set mathjax to true for posts that use equations. If not, don't (this will add in the script to load mathjax)
- I'm using imgur for hosting, the script to upload should handle it correctly
- use 'technical' and 'non-technical' tags to send to the 'random'/'side projects' section of my blog. More tags should be easy to add and make pages for if I want to expand

## Things I'd like to add in the future

[] The green first letter plugin for more titles, programmatically set (if this is possible)
[x] make the light/dark change less hacky, ideally using css vars and not the current dual-sheet setup ~~(I'm lazy)~~ DONE!
