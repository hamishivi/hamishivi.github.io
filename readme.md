# Hamish's Blog

Just a place for my random thoughts and musings :)

## Quick notes to self

- set mathjax to true for posts that use equations. If not, don't (this will add in the script to load mathjax)
- I'm using imgur for hosting, the script to upload should handle it correctly
- use 'technical' and 'non-technical' tags to send to the 'random'/'side projects' section of my blog
