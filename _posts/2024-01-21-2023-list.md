I've kept track of most media I watch, read, or play for the past few years. Here's the list of things I read/played/watched in 2023, in no particular order:

I ended up watching and playing a lot of things over the past year! It was a bit of a weird year, with a big summer break while I waited to start my PhD, so I don't know if I'll cover as much ground this year, but we will see.
