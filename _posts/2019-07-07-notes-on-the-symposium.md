description: Some notes from a class I recently took.
---

I recently had the pleasure of taking a class on Plato's *Symposium*, reading through the majority of the text, with discussion about the philosophy within. As a result, I translated the entirety of the dialogue, with some notes. Since it might be useful for someone out there, I'm embedding my notes below as a PDF. They're handwritten (and my handwriting is awful), and not everything is going to be correct (I definitely made some mistakes), so don't take it as a perfect translation! The two main commentaries I consulted while translating this are [Dover's commentary](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tlbfpkdZm5QC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [Steadman's commentary](https://geoffreysteadman.com/platos-symposium/), both of which are excellent resources.
