This is just a little update post to link to my latest uni-project-turned-github-repo - I'm working on some more original work now, though it might take some time due to University classes starting and slowly taking over my free time.

The project this time is DenserFlow, a very very very basic neural network library implemented just using Python and NumPy. This was part of a larger assignment, and I'm fairly happy with how it turned out. Check out the repository itself for examples of how it can be used. The code itself is well commented and documented (with autogenerated docs present in the repo!), meaning that it should be useful as a learning resource if you want to dig a little into how neural networks work behind the scenes! ðŸ˜„
