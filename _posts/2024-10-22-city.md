# CITY

> Once upon a time, there was a bird. One day, while the bird was sleep flying, tragedy struck and the bird's beak got stuck in a really tall boulder. The bird, who had a disease that turned it into stone if its beak got stuck, remained stuck as eons passed. At times worshipped, at times used to hang laundry, its purpose changed but it always stayed a part of the land. Until today... when a completely unrelated story in some random city started to unfold.

I recently read CITY for the first time (yes, brought on by the [impending anime announcement](link.todo)). Nichijou has remained rent-free in my brain for years, and discovering a newer, fully-formed, and in many ways much more mature manga by the same author was a real rare treat!

In many ways, CITY feels like an evolution of Nichijou in almost every way, the biggest being that the cast is massively expanded, and chapters flip between characters rapidly whilst developing them all. Where Nichijou focussed more closely on the core trio and the professor (and Nano and Sakamato), CITY tends to split its time much more across a wider cast: three college students (who are usually presented as the closest thing to main characters), a family running a restaurant, newspaper staff, the local soccer team, a theatre troupe, and so on... and most of these sets of characters not only re-occur and get arcs, but also interact with each other consistently. For example, Nagumo (of the core trio) is consistently running from Obaba, who is the grandmother of the family running the restaurant, whose son is part of the soccer team (and who is able to spend more time with soccer because Nagumo starts working part-time at the restaurant in the first chapter). Discovering these connections as you read is part of the great joy of initially reading CITY, as random details get dug into and new characters get exposed. This comes to a head various times in the manga, the three big ones being:

- The celebration after Nagumo and co escape Tanabe's tower

- The CITY race, wherein the cast comes together in a sort of wacky-races-esque duo race
